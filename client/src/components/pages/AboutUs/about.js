                    Historically, womenâ€™s voices have been grossly underrepresented in classical music. Currently, most core repertoire lists do not feature a single work written by a woman, however countless exceptional pieces exist. The issue is that to find these pieces it currently takes many hours of personal research to discover names of composers, works, recordings of the works, and where to find the musical score (if the works have been published at all!). Through the promotion of women composers and their works, the Corelia Project aims to encourage shifts in concert programming, and inspire musicians to diversify their own repertoire.
